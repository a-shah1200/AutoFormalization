 f"""You are given a mathematical statement in natural lanaguage written in LaTex, i.e Natural Language:"{message}".
                Translate the natural language version to an Isabelle version. You only need to translate the statement into Isabelle not solve it.
                For reference, I will give few examples from algebra and number theory. In each example has <Natural language version> tag which encloses latex version of statement and
                <Isabelle Version> tag which encloses the Isabelle translation of the statement. The examples are as follows:
                Algebra Examples:
                {examples[0]}
                Number Theory Examples:
                {examples[1]}
                Remember the output that you give is structured as filler and message. The message part should strictly contain only Isabelle translation and nothing else.
                Everthing else should be in filler. Transalation should only be in Isabelle version and in prediction dont include <Natural language version> or <Isabelle Version> tags.
